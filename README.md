# Telecommunication-R-project

A telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four groups. Demographic data were used to predict group membership and customize offers for prospective customers.
I performed data visualization and used classification methods like Logistic regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes.

•	Time variable: tenure (month with services)
•	Status variable: churn (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
•	Covariates: age, marital, address, employ, retire, gender, reside, and custcat
